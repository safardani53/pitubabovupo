The actor announced that his son was an NYU graduate in a 2015 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweet</a>. Treat’s son dabbled a bit in acting himself, appearing in short films in 2015, such as Let There Be Peace&nbsp;and&nbsp;Speedwriting (per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>), but he appeared to find his own lane shortly after and began pursuing music and art.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Gill is mostly a visual artist and musician now, and he occasionally shares <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clips</a> of his music and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of his artwork on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. Though he made art regularly, he appears to have taken a break from sharing, as his last Instagram post was back in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Treat occasionally shared <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of times he was bonding with his children on his own social media. Back in January 2023, he shared that he had a lovely family dinner with his wife and son, along with their family dog Nash. Earlier that month, he posted a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of both Gill and Elinor and wrote a touching message for both of them. “A shout-out to my kids Ellie and Gill who I love beyond reason.

Treat even shared photos of his daughter visiting him while working on different projects on his social media. “My daughter Ellie was on set all day.

Treat also regularly showed how proud and how much love he had for his daughter on his own social media. Just a week before his death, he shared a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of Ellie and wrote how much he missed his daughter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Ellie took to her Instagram Story on Jun. 13, to share a throwback photo of her parents while she also expressed the pain she was in amid his passing. “This is a pain I have never felt,” she wrote above the snapshot. “I am absolutely shattered.” Later, Ellie expressed her gratitude for those who have sent her kind messages about her late father. “Thank you to everyone who has sent messages and kept <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>our family</a> in your hearts during this terrible heartbreak,” she concluded. The actress later shared a photo of Treat’s family home, where he often spent time outdoors. “We’re home, Dad,” she captioned the photo of his<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> green pasture</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>On June 18, Ellie honored her dad on Father’s Day, with two posts on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Stories</a>. The first post was a throwback picture of Treat helping baby Ellie stand. “I love you, Dad. I miss you,” she wrote. The second post was a more-recent picture of Treat smiling behind the wheel of a tractor. “I took this picture of my pops when I was in college.
