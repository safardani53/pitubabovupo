dripping in the 'Uber Eats delivery driver's blood'.</p><p>Megan Dwyer was waiting for her food when she spotted the driver jumping around as if he'd trapped his finger in his car door.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600518803.jpg> <img

22-year-old says the panicked man had blood "all over his hands" but didn't clean them before grabbing her bag from the back seat, leaving it splattered in red.</p><p>The master's degree student claims the man said "I'm sorry" as he passed her a Quarter Pounder with Cheese Meal and a McChicken Sandwich Meal.</p><p>He assured concerned Megan that he had tissues in the car before rushing away.</p><p>Megan and her boyfriend ate their meals because the £18.13 order was double-bagged, but they were "in shock" that the careless driver still handled her bag rather than letting her retrieve it.</p><p>Megan, from Halesowen, <a href=#>West Midlands</a>, said: "The delivery driver was jumping around holding his finger, so I put two and two together and I was like 'has he just shut his finger in the car door?'</p><p>"He didn't put a tissue around it before picking the bag up, so as he was walking down the path his finger was literally dripping and it was all over the path and all over the bag.</p><p>"He could have cleaned his hands or offered for me to walk to the car to fetch it to save him from bringing it to the house and getting stuff on it, but he just brought it to me.</p><p>"With the initial shock of it all, I thought I should at least take it off him because his hand is bleeding everywhere and he could sort it out, but then he just ran off and I was left with it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600518856.jpg><p>Megan and boyfriend Adam Robinson, 24, had ordered from McDonald's Birchley Island in Oldbury when the driver she described as being in his late 30s to early 40s arrived at around 7.30pm.</p><p>The shocked pair brought their fast food inside where Megan's mum put gloves on to take the food out of the bags.</p><p>Megan said she had to clean her bloodied path with soapy water after they'd finished their meal.</p><p>She complained to Uber Eats the same night on July 24 but says she was shocked to only receive an apology.</p><p>It wasn't until Uber Eats were contacted by reporters that they refunded her on August 6.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600518804.jpg><p>The part-time barmaid, who lives with her mum, step dad, brother and grandma, felt her complaint on the Uber Eats app wasn't dealt with well enough at the time.</p><p>She added: "I'm not the type of person to ask for a refund over nothing, so to me that was a big deal.</p><p>"They got back to me straight away but it was hardly worth replying to me with what they said.</p><p>"It wasn't [the driver's] fault, it was an accident. But I felt like I deserved a refund or even a discount code off a next order, and that annoyed me.</p><p>"It's definitely put me off ordering from Uber Eats for a few weeks. I ordered food the other day and I got it from Deliveroo because I don't want to risk ordering from them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600519395.jpg><p>And Megan said she used to eat Maccies "quite a lot" but hasn't had one since the bloody incident.</p><p>Her 53-year-old mum Jo Hartwell took snaps of the bloodied bag before posting them to Facebook, saying "it's blood not ketchup".</p><p>One user branded it "disgusting" while another said it was the "most gross thing ever".</p><p>One person commented: "That's absolutely disgusting. I'm an Uber Eats driver and there's no way I’m giving you that bag. I'm heading straight back to Maccas."</p><p>And another wrote: "I would have refused it!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600519371.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>An Uber Eats spokesperson said: "The safety of everybody who uses the Uber Eats app is a top priority, and we are currently investigating this incident.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"All couriers are sent key information about food safety when they onboard with Uber Eats, and are regularly sent information as well."</p><p><a href=#>McDonald's</a> declined to comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn90f5VycHJnpZeys3nEmqusZZaqv6q71KxkppuUpLuiuMOsZJ2qmaW9qrrGZpmlp5%2BZeqSt0Wg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-c-murder-rapper-corey-miller-4166836.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is C-Murder?
