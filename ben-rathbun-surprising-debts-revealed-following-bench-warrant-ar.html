Maybe he wanted fame to give him a platform to express his beliefs.</p><p>Or maybe he had thousands of dollars in debt and hoped that things like Cameo calls could help him make fast money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Step three would be, according to this fan theory, that he took the risk of going to Peru.</p><p>Perhaps he hoped for leniency or to even simply avoid being caught — if he was violating his probation (which, again, we do not know).</p><p>He may have thought that the rewards — solving all of his financial problems and landing a hot wife in the process — were worth the risk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The bonus step may have been missing his probation violation hearing … by returning to Peru.</p><p>Yes, as we reported in February, Ben and Mahogany were spotted together again by a fan at a mall in Lima.</p><p>It is unclear if they were filming together again, but some wonder if Ben was out of the country for the hearing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>If so, it could even be the case that Ben’s arrest this week marked his return.</p><p>All of this speculation makes a lot of assumptions, however.</p><p>There could be simpler and less complicated reasons for one man to make a series of mistakes, some big and some small.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcK7Ep2SrmaSdr7a6jKysq6iinsCqusZmm56apKh6s7HVnpilnZRis7C4y6iuoqaXYq%2BmusKhZLCZoqeur8CMmqlo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-look-young-without-plastic-surgery-morpheus-8.html>&#171;&nbsp;All About Morpheus 8 Hollywood Life</a>
