The rom-com has made hearts melt every year since it was released on Dec. 8, 2006. The movie follows two women who swap homes in each other’s countries, where they each meet a local guy and fall in love. Aside from the adorable premise of the movie, The Holiday featured a star-studded cast:<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Cameron Diaz</a></strong>, whose character falls in love with the man played by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jude Law</strong></a>, and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Kate Winslet</strong></a>, whose romantic interest is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jack Black</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Fans have been itching for a The Holiday sequel for years, and on Dec. 5, 2022, it was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reported</a> that a script had been greenlit. Sadly, the film’s director, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nancy Meyers</strong></a>, and Kate Winslet said the rumors are not true. “So many DM’s about this – sorry but it’s not true,” Nancy <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a> on Instagram on Dec. 6. That same day, Kate said she had never even been informed of a reboot in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “I read something about that, but it’s the first I’ve heard of it. I promise you not an agent or a representative or anyone from the first one around has had any conversation with me about that,” she confirmed. “Hand on heart, that’s never come up.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>So, what are the stars of The Holiday up to since they’re not busy rebooting the classic Christmas film?

She turned into what many would call an overnight success after her 1994 film The Mask debuted. Her star power was cemented with her leading roles in 1997’s My Best Friend’s Wedding, 1998’s There’s Something About Mary, and of course, the iconic&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Charlie’s Angels movies</a>.

We are so happy, blessed and grateful to begin this new decade by announcing the birth of our daughter, Raddix Madden,” the couple wrote in a joint Instagram post in Jan. 2020. The happy couple also noted that while they were “overjoyed to share this news”, they said they felt a “strong instinct to protect our little one’s privacy.” They concluded, “From our family to all of yours, we’re sending our love and best wishes for a Happy New Year and Happy New Decade.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>After officially announcing<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> her retirement</a> in 2018 and taking some time to<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> grow her family</a>, Cameron pleasantly surprised fans in 2022 when she signed on to star alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jamie Foxx</strong> </a>in the Netflix film, Back in Action.&nbsp;“It’s a little bit of muscle memory, you know what I mean?” she said on a Sept. 2022 episode of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon </a>about her acting return. “I did that for so long, it’s kind of like the process, I kind of just fell back into it.

More impressively, she broke<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Tom Cruise</strong></a>‘s record for the longest time someone has ever held their breath under water for a film by doing so for seven minutes and 15 seconds. “I have the video of me surfacing saying, ‘Am I dead, have I died?’ And then going, ‘What was [my time]?'” she told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Total Film </a>in Dec. 2022. “Straight away I wanted to know my time. And I couldn’t believe it… The next thing I say is, ‘We need to radio set.

The impact of that film and that world, the way it penetrated and exploded my imagination, that there are more than one or two times every day where I’m walking on the sets where it hits me like a child. I get awestruck by certain characters that are around me. … it’s a wonderful experience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Aside from expanding his career, Jude expanded his family over the years.
