middle of the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Subsequent photos provided a glimpse of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">life in paradise</a>, including food and views she enjoyed and activities she participated in.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Brooke captioned the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;collection with a glowing endorsement: "Would recommend @jumbybayresort #JumbyBayIsland in Antigua in a heartbeat - had the most beautiful and loveliest few days!!"</p><p>Fans said the real site to see was Brooke.</p><p>"So [incredibly] beautiful and lovely," one person shared. "A big hug to you Brooke."</p><p>Several others name-dropped a comparison to one of her earliest movies, saying the tropical island looked like something out of the Blue Lagoon.</p><p>Others wished the award-winner well, after revealing her scare earlier this month.</p><p>"Take care of yourself," one person demanded. "Get some rest!"</p><p>Another added: "Hope you are feeling better - the best medicine is the sea!!"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SCARY SITUATION</h2><p>Brooke recently confessed she was&nbsp;<a href=#>rushed to the ICU</a>&nbsp;in September, after having a seizure.</p><p>The star&nbsp;said she collapsed "headfirst into the wall" just days before debuting her one-woman show at&nbsp;New York City's&nbsp;Cafe Carlyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/instagram-brooke-shields-husband-chris-836802684.jpg><p>Brooke opened up in&nbsp;<a href=#>Glamour's US Women of the Year issue</a>, explaining how she had a seizure outside of L’Artusi restaurant in the West Village.</p><p>"I was waiting for an&nbsp;Uber. I get down to the bottom of the steps, and I start evidently looking weird, and [the people I was with] were like, 'Are you okay?'" she said.</p><p>"I walk into the restaurant L’Artusi, and I go to the sommelier who had just taken an hour to watch my run-through. I go in, two women come up to me; I don’t know them. Everything starts to go black," Brooke continued.</p><p>"Then my hands drop to my side and I go headfirst into the wall. I start having a grand mal seizure," she continued.</p><p>Doctors later attributed the seizure, which caused her to froth at the mouth and go "totally blue," to potentially drinking too much water before the show and having too little sodium in her system.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HELPING HAND</h2><p>Brooke said fellow actor&nbsp;<a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a>, 48, was by her side in the ambulance when she woke up.</p><p>The restaurant's sommelier managed to get in touch with Bradley after first trying Brooke's husband,&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Henchy</a>, 59, who couldn't be reached.</p><p>But Chris's assistant knew the&nbsp;<a href=#>Hollywood</a>&nbsp;actor was nearby. Without hesitation, Bradley headed straight to the restaurant.</p><p>The two have been close friends for over a decade.</p><p>"The next thing I remember, I'm being loaded into an ambulance. I have oxygen on. And Bradley f**king Cooper is sitting next to me holding my hand," Brooke recalled.</p><p>"I didn’t have a sense of humor. I couldn’t really get any words out. But I thought to myself, This is what death must be like. You wake up and Bradley Cooper’s going, 'I’m going to go to the hospital with you, Brooke,' and he’s holding my hand.</p><p>"And I’m looking at my hand, I’m looking at Bradley Cooper’s hand in my hand, and I’m like, 'This is odd and surreal.'"</p><p>The model fully recovered and was able to debut her one-woman show, titled Previously Owned, on September 12.</p><p>The show successfully ran until September 23.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SUMMER PARTY</h2><p>Over the summer, Brooke's teen daughter Grier Henchy, 17, <a href=#>towered above her mom</a> in a gorgeous dress during a lavish Hamptons bash.</p><p>The model and her daughter smiled as they posed side-by-side.</p><p>Brooke and Grier were spotted at the 2023 Hampton Classic Horse Show in Bridgehampton, New York.</p><p>The teen kept it casual but chic in an off-white dress with a floral print on it and had her bright red hair down in a straight style over her shoulders.</p><p>Grier hid her eyes behind a dark pair of sunglasses and tucked a black bag under her arm.</p><p>Her mom,&nbsp;Brooke, stood by her side in a green and blue bandana-style top with white pants.</p><p>She also appeared to be wearing a chic pair of sunglasses and several bangles on her wrist.</p><p>The mother-daughter-duo appeared to be enjoying their time together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>NOT LIKE MOM</h2><p>Brooke opened up about her relationship with her daughter and more in a&nbsp;<a href=#>new documentary, Pretty Baby</a>.</p><p>In June, it was revealed that she was opposed to her daughter Grier getting into modeling, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p><p>She appeared on&nbsp;<a href=#>Live With Kelly and Mark</a>&nbsp;at the time, saying of the decision: "The rules have changed since I was [a&nbsp;<a href=#>model</a>]."</p><p>Brooke added that Grier was doing "little things here and there," and her mom wasn't into it.</p><p>She recalled: "I fought it for so long.</p><p>"It's such a different industry now than it was."</p><p>The actress went on: "We didn't have social media when I was a model," calling the industry "a rat race."</p><p>Brooke, who specialized in print, said she was nervous when her "ridiculously stunning" daughter told her she was "interested in runway."</p><p>She said: "That's brutal and backstage is just brutal. I never did runway, I don't think I would've been able to handle it."</p><p>Eventually, she said, she "had to give in," but she made sure to set some ground rules first.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Brooke told her daughter: "You are going to have a great work ethic., it's not going to be comfortable, and you're going to listen to me, those are my rules."</p><p>She also said she would not be her daughter's manager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/brooke-shields-left-daughter-grier-865475650.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000807609142.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/brooke-shields-attends-17th-annual-865467469.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaG2CdISWaJmrp5%2Bgsm6%2Fx6KcpZyjYrGmssieqmaZl5p6s7vCpKpmn5yWwLSx0maZpZmqmr9uw8CloqKml2KxsLOO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cardi-b-and-offset-a-timeline-of-their-relationship.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cardi B and Offset's Relationship Timeline: Photos</a>
