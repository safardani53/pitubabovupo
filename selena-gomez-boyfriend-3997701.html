However, the singer and actress recently confirmed that she and record producer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Benny Blanco</strong> are dating</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>At the beginning of the year, Selena was <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>briefly linked</a> to&nbsp;<strong>Drew Taggart</strong> of The Chainsmokers, and they were even photographed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>holding hands</a> in NYC. Amidst the apparent fling, though, Selena shut down speculation that she was in a relationship. “I like being alone too much,” she wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “#IAmSingle.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Sel doubled down on this in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a> video posted in March 2023. In <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the clip</a>, she mouthed along to a woman saying, “My crush doesn’t even exist.” She also captioned the video, ‘Still out here looking for him.” In a subsequent <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a> video, posted in June 2023, Selena hilariously <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shouted out her single status</a> while watching a bunch of guys play soccer. “I’m single!” she screamed. “I’m just a little high maintenance! But I love you sooooo!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Then, in August 2023, Selena <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>released</a> her song called “Single Soon.” She confirmed that the song had been written “a while back,” though, meaning the track might be unrelated to her current status. In the past, Selena’s been linked to some very famous faces. Look back at her love life here:</p><h2>Nick Jonas</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/selena-gomez-nick-jonas-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Back when they were young Disney stars, Selena and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a> had a cute little romance that started in 2008 after he broke up with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miley</strong> <strong>Cyrus</strong></a>. Selena even played Nick’s love interest in the <strong>Jonas Brothers</strong>’ 2008 music video, “Burnin’ Up.” Sadly, the romance didn’t last very long. And in 2015, Selena <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>remembered the innocent fling</a> as “puppy love, you know, it was very sweet.”</p><h2>Taylor Lautner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selena-gomez-and-Taylor-Lautner-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Another one of Selena’s earliest studs was none other than Twilight star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Lautner</strong></a>! They met in 2009 while filming movies in Vancouver (Selena was shooting Ramona and Beezus&nbsp;and Taylor was shooting&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twilight: New Moon</a>).</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristen [Stewart]</strong></a> was staying in my hotel. [Taylor] would visit her, so we were constantly running into each other in the lobby—and we ended up meeting,” Selena explained in a 2009 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seventeen</a>. “We would go out to lunch and dinner, but I knew he had paparazzi following him and I had paparazzi following me. So we literally just wanted to hang out, go bowling and stuff, and it went a little too far, I think. People were getting a little crazy about us.” However, Selena confirmed she was single by the time of her&nbsp;Seventeen&nbsp;interview. Her best friend,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, went on to date Taylor for several months later that year.</p><h2>Zedd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/selena-gomez-and-Zedd-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>The “Naturally” songstress also had a brief fling with internationally known <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>DJ</strong> <strong>Zedd</strong></a>, whom she dated at the beginning of 2015 after meeting at a recording studio. The two worked together on the song&nbsp; “I Want You To Know,” which was released in Feb. 2015. Ahead of the song’s release, they teased the collaboration with flirty <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media posts</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“He’s this cute little German, and he’s got really beautiful eyes and he’s very sweet and funny,” Selena gushed at the time. She also called Zedd “talented” in an interview. By April, the two had called it quits, but remained on good terms. “I adore [him] a lot and I definitely had a thing with him, which was nice,” Selena admitted in July 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Selena also sparked romance speculation with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>One Direction</a></strong> singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a> in 2015 (and then again in 2019), and with Pirates of the Caribbean star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Orlando Bloom </strong></a>in 2014 and 2016! However, Selena denied the romance speculation for the last two (Niall also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>denied the years-long rumors</a> in 2020).</p><h2>Charlie Puth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/selena-gomez-and-Charlie-Puth-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Selena and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Charlie Puth</strong> </a>collaborated on the track “We Don’t Talk Anymore” in 2016, but there was some talking between the two going on behind the scenes. “I don’t kiss and tell, but the only way a song like [‘We Don’t Talk Anymore’] can come across as real is if there’s something else going on behind the scenes,” Charlie said in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>. “And that’s what was happening [with Gomez]. Very short-lived, very small, but very impactful. And it really messed me up. I’m trying to put this the best way possible: It wasn’t like I was the only person on her mind. And I think I knew that going in — what I was getting myself into.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Later on, however, a source close to Selena shared with&nbsp;PEOPLE that the two “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>never dated</a>.”</p><h2>Justin Bieber</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Selena’s two most famous relationships were with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a>. If there is one celebrity couple that defines what on-again, off-again means it is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Selena and Justin</a>. They sparked dating rumors in 2010 after hanging out at IHOP together, and the relationship became official in 2011 with a red carpet appearance at the Vanity Fair Oscars Party (followed by many more dates at high-profile events).</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>The two were on and off until 2018. In between their “on” moments, they both dated other people. Of course, for Justin, one of those women was&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong></a>, who he eventually married. Justin and Selena were linked in the fall of 2017 and beginning of 2018, but split for good that March. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for a full timeline of their love.</p><h2>The Weeknd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-weeknd-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Selena and The Weeknd dated for 10 months in 2017. The two first met at the 2015 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show when they both performed on the catwalk. It wasn’t until Jan. 2017, though, that they were first linked romantically after being spotted on a dinner date in L.A. The outing was followed by more sightings, as well as a trip to Italy later that month, where they went Instagram official.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The exes made their relationship very public by attending the Met Gala together in May 2017. They also went to Coachella together that spring. “It’s really hard when I would want to spend so much time hiding things,” Selena admitted during an interview with On Air With Ryan Seacrest in July 2017. “It’s too much pressure, and I think everyone gets over everything eventually … I just want to be happy. If that’s me just being myself, then I don’t really care.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The two eventually called it quits in October 2017, but Selena said that they ended on good terms. “Something that I’m really proud of is that there’s such a true friendship [between us]” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a> in Nov. 2015. “I truly have never experienced anything like that in my life. We ended it as best friends, and it was genuinely about encouraging and caring [for each other], and that was pretty remarkable for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>In March 2018, The Weeknd released his&nbsp;My Dear Melancholy EP, and there seemed to be many <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>references to Selena</a>. On the track “Call Out My Name,” he even hinted that he offered to donate his kidney to her when she needed a transplant the previous summer. “I almost cut a piece of myself for your life,” he sings in the song.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>In August 2023,<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Selena denied</a> that her new song “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Single Soon”</a> was about The Weeknd. “Couldn’t be more false,” she said directly to <strong>Hollywood Life</strong> on Instagram.</p><h2>Drew Taggart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Selena-Gomez-Reportedly-Dating-The-Chainsmokers-Drew-Taggart-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-21>In Jan. 2023, it was reported that Selena and The Chainsmokers’ Drew Taggart have been “casually” dating. “They aren’t trying to hide their romance by sneaking around at members only clubs,” an insider told Us Weekly, adding that their new romance is “very casual and low-key.” They “go bowling and to the movies” when they spend time together, the source added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Selena is very “affectionate” with the rocker, the insider noted, and she “can hardly keep her hands off him”. Overall, they’re “having a lot of fun together”, the insider said at the time. While they were photographed in public together a handful of times, though, the romance quickly fizzled out, with Selena insisting that she was “single” by the end of the month.</p><h2>Benny Blanco</h2><p id=content-paragraph-23><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/selena-gomez-benny-blanco-romance-FEAT.jpg alt="Selena Gomez Confirms Benny Blanco Romance and Shares Loved-up Photo" width=620 height=350 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p id=content-paragraph-24>In December 2023, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Selena confirmed</a> that she is dating record producer <strong>Benny Blanco</strong>, 35. After PopFactions shared a post captioned, “Selena Gomez seemingly confirms she’s in a relationship,” the Disney Channel alum commented, “Facts.” The pop singer also “liked” multiple posts from the tabloid’s Instagram account that month, which referred to her and Benny’s newfound romance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>Selena and Benny have reportedly worked together in the past on her music. In 2019, they collaborated on her song “I Can’t Get Enough.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>While responding to online comments about her new relationship, Selena clarified that she has been dating him for “six months,” which indicates that they began their romance in June of this year. After publicly declaring their newfound love, Benny left a flirtatious comment under one of Selena’s Instagram posts: a heart eyes emoji.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Keo56mkWK0sLnEs2Sbp6mbv6qxzZ1kbHFpbIRxfY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./brian-robinson-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Brian Robinson (cyclist)</a>
