Jerry was being pulled behind a boat on Kentucky Lake in Tennessee — not that far away from his family's home in Dickson — when he went under. Although he was wearing a life jacket at the time, he didn't resurface.</p><p>A large and highly-coordinated search ensued, leading to Jerry's body being found the next day.</p><p>"We just had to find him," Karen Greer, Jerry's mother and Craig's wife, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in 2018. "We just had to find his body. We had to deal with Alex, Kyle and Wyatt. That was it. Jerry was gone, and we knew that. I wanted him found.

He did so with a single titled "The Father, My Son and the Holy Ghost."</p><p>“Its simplicity embraces the truth of the lyrics of the song,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig told CMT,</a> of the accompanying music video. “I hope this video lifts people up. For anyone who has experienced loss, I want this song to give them the desire to pursue their faith and to have hope.”</p><p>The song ended up reaching the number one spot on iTunes' all-genre chart thanks in part to fellow country singer <a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>, who encouraged others to support it.</p><p>"I would gladly give up my spot on country radio to get this song on.
