He used to say what a lovely lady she was and how much he loved her, and how he wishes he had told her more," she recalls.</p><p>"It was nice to have that sense of her still being around.</p><p>"I had my older brothers and sisters to look after me. Especially the second oldest - she was like a real mother figure to me.</p><p>"I felt really lucky to have that because I didn't feel like I was missing out too much in regards to not having a mum."</p><p>I had my older brothers and sisters to look after me.

It helped support the 10 of us. We also had our stables, run&nbsp;by the older kids.</p><p>"There were a few horses to ride and learn how to race. It was a different upbringing from the friends I went to school with.</p><p>"But it taught us a good work ethic and prepared us for the tough world of horse racing."</p><p>Her nine siblings are Stevie - who has <a href=#>Down's syndrome</a> and works as her strapper, helping to groom her horses - Cathy, Patrick, Maree, Michael, Therese, Bernadette, Margaret, Andrew and Brigid who died in 2007 aged 36.</p><p>Speaking about Stevie, Michelle says he was treated "just like another child" in their family, because there were so many of them.</p><p>"He didn't get any special help - he just had to learn things and I think it made him into who he is today," she says. "I think people underestimate Down's syndrome in a lot of ways."</p><h2>Childhood dream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/michelle-payne-celebrates-riding-prince-446124732.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/michelle-payne-seen-2022-826373853.jpg><p>After watching her brother Patrick become the youngest person to compete at the Melbourne Cup at 17, she decided she wanted to follow in his footsteps - and go one better.</p><p>"The enormity and excitement absolutely captivated me and I just remember thinking, 'One day, I want to try to win the Melbourne Cup'," she says.</p><p>She was so resolute she kept telling friends that she would one day win the prestigious race.</p><p>Michelle watched her older sisters struggle to compete in the male-dominated sport - but their dad was their biggest cheerleader.</p><p>She says: "They were strong and my dad supported them and used to say the girls are good as the boys and they just need the opportunities.</p><p>"I grew up with the confidence that I was able to do it if I got the opportunity and worked really hard. It was a drive of mine from five years old and I couldn't wait to try to do it."</p><p>After years of hard work and perfecting her craft, Michelle landed a chance with the legendary Bart Cummings, one of Australia's most prolific horse trainers.</p><p>She competed in her first Melbourne Cup at 24. The following year she defied all odds to steer rank outsider Prince of Penzance to victory - fulfilling her lifelong ambition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/576d053d-87b7-4b2d-a46b-aebcb6c92f59.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2015-melbourne-cup-riding-prince-826375391.jpg><p>Recalling her 100-1 triumph, she says: "When I went over the finishing line with Prince of Penzance, I just shook my head in disbelief and relief. I was just ecstatic.</p><p>"It was the most surreal, unbelievable feeling and I was so grateful that it all came together for me that day."</p><p>As well as the iconic trophy, Michelle collected an eye-watering £3.2million prize pot - and delivered a memorable post-race interview slamming sexism in horseracing.</p><p>“It’s such a chauvinistic sport, a lot of the owners wanted to kick me off," she said.</p><p>"Everyone else can get stuffed [who] think women aren’t good enough."</p><p>Michelle says it was the "best feeling" to win Australia's greatest 155-year-old race and "to stand up there and say something".</p><p>"That's why I made those comments which have become famous after the race. I didn't have the support of some of the stables that I had in previous years so I had to really work extra hard and just hoped that a bit of luck would come my way," she says.</p><p>"We've got some amazing talent coming through the riding ranks and I'm sure it's going to get stronger and stronger with the girls that are coming through and just knowing that it's achievable."</p><p>Michelle hasn't had an easy ride, having dealt with major injuries including a horror fall in 2004 which left her with a fractured skull and bruising to the brain.</p><p>Another in 2012 saw her fracture four vertebrae and suffer broken ribs and a cracked collarbone.</p><p>Michelle has had six major concussions throughout the course of her career and hopes it hasn't caused any long-term damage.</p><p>In 2016 she had to be airlifted to a hospital after a fall caused horrific abdominal injuries and doctors had to reattach part of her pancreas.</p><p>The following year she was handed a four-week ban when she tested positive for phentermine, a banned appetite suppression drug.</p><p>Owning her mistake, at the time she said: "The onus is 100 per cent with me… I regret not seeking more guidance, I wasn’t thorough, and that is completely my fault. My sincere apologies to everyone."</p><h2>Life on the big screen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/i-m-queen-horse-racing-826302350.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NINTCHDBPICT000826374551.jpg><p>It did nothing to tarnish her reputation, and in 2019 a film about her life - Ride Like a Girl - was released, starring Teresa Palmer as Michelle and brother Stevie as himself.</p><p>She recalls: "I was very overwhelmed [when I heard about the movie]. It was amazing.</p><p>"I didn't have too much to do with the production because it was so overwhelming and I had to trust them. But when Stevie was cast as himself, that's when it got really exciting.</p><p>"The one thing we had to be mindful of was the scene where my mum was killed in the car accident.</p><p>"I don't remember it because I was a baby but I felt like it wouldn't be fair for my older siblings to have to relive that so they were very conscious and had good respect."</p><p>In 2021 Michelle was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia.</p><p>Speaking about her new role as part of ITV's presenting team at the Royal Ascot, she says: "What I love about commentating is being able to bring a different perspective to riding.</p><p>"Now, as a trainer, I can talk about the intricate details that are different with each horse, jockey, and scenario.</p><p>"It's also great to be working with <a href=#>Francesca Cumani</a> and Jason Weaver - I know those two really well and I think it will be a lot of fun."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Although she's a superstar in her native country, Michelle admits her love life hasn't been anywhere as exciting.</p><p>"It's very boring. I'm still on the lookout," she laughs. When asked about her ideal man she jokes: "I haven't found him yet so I'm not sure."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NINTCHDBPICT000826545684.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/i-m-queen-horse-racing-826302329.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ridden-michelle-payne-returns-mounting-446132348-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/michelle-payne-seen-posing-2021-826374161.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zg5RtanBrX528s7%2FEq5icoZ6ceqLB0q2pmqSZlnq1vsCgnJ2xXaq9o77Ip56ippdiuqqvx56jpZ1dpa66usRmqaixkaF6or%2FCqKto</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kate-middleton-prince-william-christmas-2023-outing-with-children-prince-george-princess-charlotte-prince-louis-8414751.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kate Middleton and Prince William Attend Royal Christmas 2023 with Kids</a>
