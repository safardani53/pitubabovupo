Therefore, he moved to&nbsp;<strong>Cookeville, Tennessee</strong>, where he is currently living with his family.</p><p>At his new residence, he attended Cookeville High School. Furthermore, he played baseball there. Also, he was an all-district, all-region second baseman player.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, he then participated in football during high school. Thus, upon graduating in 2005, Froning received a baseball scholarship to Walters State Community College.</p><p>Soon after, the player decided to end his baseball career. Then, he began working at the Cookeville Fire Department and continued his curriculum studies at&nbsp;Tennessee Technological University.&nbsp;</p><p>While he was working out with the fire department at his young age, Rich Froning started getting interested in CrossFit, which he soon developed a passion for, and in 2010, he began coaching and competing.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Saeideh Aletaha Bio: Death, Brain Injury, MMA & Early Life >></a></strong></p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>However, Rich Froning Jr has competed in the CrossFit Games since the year 2010. Not to mention, he won the<strong> CrossFit Games of the year.</strong></p><p>Additionally, it followed up by winning every stage of the 2012-2014 Games season, including<strong> the Open of worldwide, the Regionals, </strong>and<strong> the entire league.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Therefore, his winning streak ended after he retired from Individual Competition in 2015.</p><p>He subsequently took second place in the world in the Open of 2015, behind another proficient player <a href=#>Mathew Fraser</a>.</p><p>However, he began a recent winning streak by earning first place at both <strong>the 2015 Central East Regional </strong>and the Games as part of his new team,<strong> CrossFit Mayhem Freedom</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, Froning once has said,</p><p>“It’s not necessarily that I always like to win, but I hate losing more than anything.”</p><h3>What is a cross-fit game?</h3><p>The CrossFit Games are the ultimate testing grounds for the Fittest Man and Fittest Woman on EarthTM and are recognized worldwide as the ultimate fitness test.</p><p>Fans worldwide have attended the multi-day sporting event, streamed the competition live, or watched it on <strong>ESPN</strong>, <strong>CBS</strong>, or several foreign broadcasts for the past 14 years.</p><p>Athletes from over 120 nations competed on the international stage.</p><p>The Worldwide Open, the world’s biggest participatory sporting event, is the starting point for the CrossFit Games.</p><p>One possibility is published online for the three-week competition every Thursday, and competitors have four days to record and submit scores.</p><p>Anyone <strong>over the age of 14</strong> will register for the first stage of the CrossFit Games season, which includes categories for youth, age ranges, and adaptive athletes.</p><p>However, the 2021 year’s Open will be the most accessible in CrossFit history, with athletes having the choice of competing at a nearby gym or home with basic or no equipment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Randa Markos: UFC, Record, Sherdog, Husband & Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h3>Southeast Regional Competition</h3><p>In 2010, Rich Froning qualified for the <strong>Southeast Regional competition 2010</strong> through the <strong>Sectional Qualifiers</strong>‘ qualification round.</p><p>At the Games of 2010, Rich Froning earned five ‘<strong>Top 5</strong>‘ finishes, including two event wins. Therefore he never dropped below the 13th.</p><p>After that, he was then heading into the final gaming match.</p><p>However, the rope climb part of the final match exposed “a chink in his armor” regarding the procedure.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dw-HsMEXgAEorHh-819x1024.jpg><p>Froning, also, he was unaware of how to wrap his legs and feet around the prop rope, then he was forced to attempt the string climbs only using his arms.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the fatigued Rich Froning then fell from the rope multiple times throughout the game.</p><p>The Games podium of 2010 had <strong>Holmberg in first</strong>, followed by the star <strong>Froning</strong> in second place, and third place by <strong>Chris Spealler</strong>.</p><p>Froning and Annie Thorisdottir, in the year 2012, were the first athletes to win the game of CrossFit twice.</p><p>Therefore, Froning was the first athlete as “<strong>Fittest Man on Earth</strong>” by winning Crossfit Games four consecutive years in the years following.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, in a documentary released in the summer of 2015, “<strong>Froning</strong>,” documentary filmmakers from CrossFit, Inc., suggested that Froning is the “<strong>Fittest Man in History.”</strong></p><p>However, in each of the years since, Rich Froning has qualified for Regionals as an individual.</p><p>Furthermore, he then chose to participate in the team competition instead of as part of the “Mayhem Freedom” team.</p><p>Later, followed by securing first place in the Games in 2015 and 2016 and second in 2017.</p><h2>Diet and Training</h2><p>Froning does not stick to either the Paleolithic diet or the Zone diet, hyped up in the CrossFit player society.</p><p>Furthermore, Froning states that he does not like to stick to any specific diet plan and does not believe in calorie intake.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, he eats substantial amounts of <strong>peanut butter</strong> and prefers drinking whole <strong>milk</strong> as a drink. Both of his preferences are not compliant with the standards of Paleo.&nbsp;</p><p>However, according to him, he typically does not eat an excessive amount of food during the day.</p><p>Instead, he prefers eating a large meal at night and drinking protein shakes multiple times.</p><p>Moreover, he reports that he works out multiple times a day, and, unlike any other athlete, he doesn’t like taking off from training days. Rich Froning doesn’t have any workout or coach for his training and is his own coach.</p><p>Instead, he often finds an exceptional athlete to be his training partners, such as Games athletes Dan Bailey and James Hobart.</p><p>Some of Froning’s methods are discussed in his 2013 memoir,&nbsp;First: What It Takes to Win.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Froning is a <strong>Christian</strong>.
