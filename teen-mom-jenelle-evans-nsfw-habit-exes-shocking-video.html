question about romantic partners watching pornographic materials.</p><p>The North Carolina native filmed her response, saying: "I think respect your girlfriend's wishes. If she doesn't like it, then don't do it. I mean, would you want her looking at some dude that's hotter than you? I don't think so.</p><p>"Honestly, it makes girls feel insecure. Honestly. I don't like it. I had that problem in the past with many of my relationships so I think a lot of girls deal with it. Not just you. Sometimes guys will respect it, sometimes they won't."</p><p>It wasn't clear who she was talking about in the clip, but that hasn't stopped fans from reacting.</p><p>The clip was shared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, where fans speculated about Jenelle's comments and ripped her for having a sexy OnlyFans account.</p><p>"Says the woman who gets paid by other women's bf's/husbands to look at her t**s and a**. My God," one critic commented.</p><p>Someone else guessed: "Bf? You mean husband?"</p><p>"Jenelle has never respected another human’s wishes in her life lmao," a third hater wrote.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Many seem to think Jenelle may have been hinting at problems in her own relationship with her response.</p><h2>TROUBLE IN PARADISE?</h2><p>During the same Q&A on social media, the mom of three was asked about her personal life and well-being.</p><p>She <a href=#>confessed that she was struggling</a> a bit, and had been laying low.</p><p>Then, when she fielded the question about porn, speculation picked up.</p><p>Fans on Reddit suggested that Jenelle might be hinting at issues in her relationship.</p><p>One person commented: "So she saw <a href=#>David</a> looking at porn on his phone and that’s what set off this whole mopey string of IG stories??"</p><p>A second fan, jokingly asked, "But why would she refer to her husband as her bf?"</p><p>Another commenter mocked Jenelle, writing "I don't like it or approve of it, here's the link to my spicy site."</p><p>A liked-minded Redditor quickly piggybacked off the commenter's remark, stating "That's the part that doesn't make sense. She doesn't like her guy looking at porn, it makes her and other women feel insecure...but then she goes and uploads "spicy" photos for OF?"</p><p>One confused fan questioned: "I just need to know who in their right mind would seek any sort of relationship advice from this woman."</p><p>A second person responded: "I actually thought Jenelle submitted all of those questions herself."</p><p>"There’s no way that 90% of these questions haven’t been written by her," added another.</p><h2>SWITCH UP</h2><p>While answering another fan's question, Jenelle revealed that she had been&nbsp;<a href=#>wanting to move</a>&nbsp;during a since-deleted video response.&nbsp;</p><p>Jenelle opened up about her feelings while responding to her Instagram followers during a Q&A.</p><p>The fan asked, "How are you mentally?" which prompted Jenelle to answer, "Could be better..."</p><p>The reality star&nbsp;continued, "I just want my family complete. Think about it every day," before also adding, "And I think I want to move."</p><p>Jenelle's since-deleted post was screengrabbed and reposted on a&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom</a>-dedicated&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;board under the title: "Wants to move off the swamp?!?"</p><p>Fans rushed to the post's comment section to decipher the meaning behind the reality TV star's response.</p><p>One person wrote: "Oh man I hope that 'complete' doesn’t mean more children."</p><p>Another quickly replied, "She means get Jace back."</p><p>A third fan questioned, "Why does she even want Jace at this point? She dodges her responsibilities already, adding another kid is more responsibility."</p><p>"She wants Jace back strictly as a “f**k you” to Barb and all the hatters who said she’d never get him back," chimed a fourth.</p><p>While a fifth commenter stated, "She wants her family 'together' for the principle of it, not because she genuinely wants her family together."</p><p>Others focused on Jenelle expressing that she wants to move from their North Carolina home.</p><p>One fan commented: "I think Jenelle and David had a bad fight and that's why she's saying she wants to move."</p><p>A second person wrote: "No one will EVER buy that place. It’s a piece of s**t and they’d try to sell it for WAY more [than] it’s worth."</p><p>"Not to mention the pet graveyard on the land," added another.</p><p>The comment is referring to the family's&nbsp;<a href=#>pet goat, Elvis</a>, whom David killed and ate, as well as Janelle's dog Nugget, whom the former Teen Mom star shot.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>A fourth commenter admitted: "I selfishly hope Jenelle can get off the land and away from David. I think MTV would take her back in a heartbeat if she was David-free and we’d have some exciting TV to watch again."</p><p>"Well, she'll never get Jace back so if she moves away she'll be moving away from him," mentioned a final Redditor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/wheres-manners-teen-mom-fans-757272671.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/7150322937097194794-copy-url-1-webapp-765508752-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/www-instagram-com-p-ckjyuq1o-770831606.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZW6FdoOUaKuenZ5iurC5jKOcp52cobJusdWapaxlnqizuHnHmpmirF2axaa%2FjKyfqJubnruoedWim56nXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-william-moseley-dating.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is William Moseley Dating Now</a>
