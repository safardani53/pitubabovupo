We also get into the software and range of games, mobile compatibility, customer service, and more.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pros and cons of Funrize&nbsp;Casino</h2><p>Our experts found plenty of things to like at Funrize, as well as some areas we think could be improved. An overview is below:</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Excellent range of slots</li><li>Fun loyalty club</li><li>Mobile apps for iOS and Android</li><li>Live chat support</li><li>Unique Fishing games</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No table games</li><li>An improved Help/FAQ section would be nice</li><li>$100 minimum cash redemption&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üí∞ Funrize Casino bonuses and promotions</h2><p>Bonuses are pretty much at the heart of <a href=#>social casinos</a> like Funrize, even more so than at traditional real money casinos. For one thing, all the games at Funrize can be played using two types of free virtual currency - and you can build up your supply of both through various free bonuses.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Tournament Coins (the Funrize version of Gold Coins) and Promotional Entries (the Funrize version of Sweeps Coins) can be picked up for free in lots of ways. You can also purchase Tournament Coins if you want, which we cover in this section too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Funrize Casino Bonus Code</strong></p><p>Sign up with the links on our page and use bonus code <strong>SUN-US-FUNRIZE</strong> to get 75,000 Free Coins upon registering.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="Get 75,000 free coins at Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Get 75,000 free coins at Funrize</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Funrize Casino Welcome bonus</h3><p>The <strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> casino welcome bonus is rather unique among sweeps casinos. For one thing, it‚Äôs not so much a single bonus but a series of little bonuses you unlock as you go through the process of signing up and populating your account - almost like a mini game.&nbsp;</p><p>It kicks off with 75,000 Tournament Coins waiting for you in your account, as soon as you sign up. You‚Äôll get another 10,000 TCs when you verify your account via email, 25,000 TCs when you verify your phone number and then another 15,000 TCs just for filling out your profile. That‚Äôs a total of 125,000 TCs in welcome bonuses.</p><p>You‚Äôll also get to spin the Funrize Wheel off the bat (more on that below), which is your chance to kick off with some Promotional Entries to enter sweepstakes games.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, we really like the interactive, step-by-step nature of the welcome bonus. Our only criticism is that you aren‚Äôt actually guaranteed some PEs as part of the bonus, even if there is a pretty good chance you‚Äôll hit some on the Wheel.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Funrize welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/thesun-funrize-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Register now and collect 75,000 free coins</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Funrize purchase offers</h3><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> has various purchase offers for Tournament Coins, including a special 200% bonus for new members who make their first purchase. That offer is for a $11.99 package of 360,000 Tournament Coins, which comes with 1,680 free Promotional Entries.&nbsp;</p><p>That‚Äôs the best value package for newcomers, but there are other options too if it doesn‚Äôt suit them. All in all, the TC packages range from just $1.99 up to $199.99, and they all come with some free PEs. You can click the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button to see the different options.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Funrize tournament promotions</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/thesun-funrize-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Find promotions for tournament coins and play at Funrize!</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Funrize loyalty offers</h3><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> has a kind of loyalty program that is connected with its daily bonus. Let‚Äôs unpack how it works.</p><p>Rather than a straightforward login bonus that hands out free TCs and PEs, players are given the chance to spin the Funrize Wheel once a day. The Wheel hands out a random prize of either Tournament Coins or Tournament Coins + Promotional Entries.&nbsp;</p><p>When you sign up with Funrize you also get automatically enrolled in the Funrize Club. This consists of 7 different levels you can rise through, by earning points by playing the games at Funrize Casino. Once you reach a new level, the prizes on offer on the Funrie Wheel get more valuable.&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs a fun thing to keep track of while you play, and we like getting to spin the wheel every day.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Invite Friends</h3><p>Funrize has a referral promotion that can benefit both you and any friends you get to sign up. When you join, you‚Äôll find your unique referral link, as well as a QR code and promo code connected to your account.&nbsp;</p><p>Your friend simply needs to use any of these to <strong><a href=# aria-label="sign up to Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">sign up to Funrize</a></strong> and make their first purchase of TCs worth $19.99 or more. That‚Äôs enough to trigger 500,000 TCs and 2,000 PEs for you, along with 400,000 TCs and 500 PCs for your friend.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üìã How to register at Funrize social casino</h2><p>Creating your <strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> account is very simple. In general, signing up for social casinos is faster and easier than creating an account at a traditional real money casino, and typically requires less information.&nbsp;</p><p>You can join Funrize using your existing Facebook or Google account, which will automatically take your personal details from those platforms and connect your accounts. Alternatively, you can manually set up your account, which just requires an email address or phone number, along with a unique password. You‚Äôll also have to accept Funrize‚Äôs terms of service.</p><p>Once your account has been created, you can provide several other pieces of information to build out your profile. As we‚Äôve covered, each step unlocks a new portion of your welcome bonus, so you pick up Tournament Coins as you complete them. Here‚Äôs the information you can use to build out your profile:</p><ul><li>Full name</li><li>Date of birth</li><li>Full address</li><li>Phone number</li></ul><p>Overall, signing up to Funrize couldn‚Äôt really be much simpler.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center>üéÅ <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>Get 75,000 free coins when you Join Funrize!</strong></a> üéÅ</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üí≥ Funrize banking methods</h2><p>When it comes to this section, we like to see a couple of things. We want multiple different payment methods so that players can choose whichever one makes sense for them. We want transactions to be fast and easy, and we want them to be free. <strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> pretty much covers all of this.&nbsp;</p><p>You can purchase Tournament Coins with bank cards or bank transfers, which are generally the most popular methods. There‚Äôs also Apple Pay, which works very well if you use that service. We‚Äôd like to see an e-wallet option added, like PayPal or Skrill, which would definitely be a welcome addition.&nbsp;</p><p>But overall, we‚Äôre satisfied. During our tests, our purchases were completed pretty much instantly, with no extra fees, and our Tournament Coins and free bonus Promotional Entries hit our account right away.&nbsp;</p><p>All the methods are here:</p><ul><li>Visa</li><li>Mastercard</li><li>Discover</li><li>Apple Pay</li><li>Trustly Bank Transfer</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üéÅ How to redeem cash prizes at Funrize&nbsp;</h2><p>Let‚Äôs get the basics straight first.</p><p>All the games at <strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> can be played in two separate ways - by using either Tournament Coins or Promotional Entries. You can get both for free, but only Promotional Entries can be redeemed for prizes.</p><p>When you play using Tournament Coins, there are no prizes up for grabs and no value at all outside of Funrize Casino. They exist solely to play the games at Funrize. You can also purchase extra TCs if you want.</p><p>Promotional Entries are similar, but they can be redeemed for prizes when you win more through playing games. Unlike TCs, they can never be purchased, only received for free via various bonuses and giveaways. This is an essential component of the sweepstakes model that Funrize uses.&nbsp;</p><p>You can only redeem Promotional Entries that you have won, rather than received via a free bonus. This basically works like a 1x playthrough attached to any PEs you get for free.&nbsp;</p><p>Eligible PEs can be redeemed at a rate of PE1 for $0.01, or, to look at it another way, PE100 for $1. To request a gift card redemption, you need at least 2,500 eligible PEs in your account, which works out at a $25 card. The minimum cash redemption is $100, or 10,000 PEs.&nbsp;</p><p>When you request a redemption, the cash prize gets sent back via the same method you used to purchase Tournament Coins. If this isn‚Äôt possible, you can nominate an alternative bank account in your name. Gift cards simply get sent to your email address.&nbsp;</p><p>The process for requesting a redemption is very simple. Just choose the options in the menu and follow the instructions. You should factor in at least 48 hours before your redemption is processed and the money hits your account.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Funrize welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/thesun-funrize-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Register now and collect 75,000 free coins</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üé≤ What casino-style games are available at Funrize?&nbsp;</h2><p>In total, there are around 80 different games on the menu at Funrize, the vast majority of which are slots and provided by NetGame. If you‚Äôre pretty much exclusively interested in slots, Funrize is a really great option. But if you want a more diverse selection, you might be disappointed. We‚Äôre getting into all of it in this section.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>üé∞ Funrize slots</h3><p>The variety of slots on offer is excellent. Much of the software at <strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> comes from a provider called NetGame. They aren‚Äôt the biggest name in the industry, but from what we‚Äôve seen so far we‚Äôre definitely impressed.</p><p>The software and graphics are great, along with imagination that has gone into the various themes and design. Some games - like Big Catch Bonanza and the Book of Nile series - are clearly inspired by long time popular games at real money casinos. But Funrize‚Äôs editions feel both fresh and interesting, rather than just a reheated pastiche.</p><p>There are also Hold ‚Äòn‚Äô Link slot games, which let you trigger respins and land one of four separate bonuses - Mini, Minor, Major or Grand. We also like the little information box that pops up about each game when you click it, before it launches, and the ability to save your favorites by clicking the heart.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>üÉè Funrize table games</h3><p>This is where things start to get a little thin on the ground. Funrize doesn‚Äôt have traditional table games like blackjack, roulette or baccarat. In fact, pretty much the only non-slot games are three ‚ÄúFishing‚Äù games, which are interactive games that let you aim at various fishes to collect their prizes. They‚Äôre fun, but we‚Äôd like to see even more variety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>ü§µ Funrize live dealer games</h3><p>As is the case with most social casinos, Funrize does not include live dealer games. This is something that is changing in the industry, and we‚Äôd like to see them added down the line. However, starting with some regular virtual table games probably makes the most sense.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Funrize welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/thesun-funrize-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Register now and collect 75,000 free coins</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üì± Funrize mobile app</h2><p>Unlike many social casinos, <strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> has mobile apps available for both iOS and Android. The app does a good job of optimizing the whole Funrize experience for the small screen, with pretty much exactly the same functionality on mobile as on desktop. You can play the games of course, but also purchase additional Coins and request prize redemptions very easily.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, we did also come across a couple of bugs in the mobile platform, which could do with being ironed out. Overall, it doesn‚Äôt really affect the user experience too much, but it‚Äôs something to be aware of.&nbsp;</p><p>The Funrize Casino app is currently rated around 3.9/5 on the App Store, which feels about right to us.&nbsp;</p><p>If you prefer not to download the app, the software is also optimized for mobile access just by searching for the website using your phone‚Äôs browser. This works very well too, and feels pretty similar to the app.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Funrize loyalty rewards</h2><p>We‚Äôve kind of covered this already, but Funrize‚Äôs main loyalty feature is the Funrize Club and the associated Funrize Club Rewards. The idea behind this is pretty simple - the more you play and engage, the more benefits you unlock. The first step to unlock the Funrize Club is to complete your profile verification, which also triggers additional Tournament Coins.&nbsp;</p><p>There are seven different levels of the Funrize Club: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Sapphire, Diamond, and VIP. Each one unlocks new bonuses, including better prizes on the daily Funrize Wheel.</p><p>You rise through the ranks by earning XP (Experience Points) through playing the games at Funrize. For some reason, fishing games are exempt from earning XP.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üìû Funrize customer support</h2><p>The customer support options at <strong><a href=# aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> are very good, and among the most extensive and versatile at social casinos in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, and most importantly from our perspective, Funrize has live chat support. This is easily our favorite way to get support, and the button to open the chat is constantly hovering at the bottom of the screen. During our tests, we got fast and clear answers to the questions we had along the way with the site. We‚Äôre impressed.</p><p>If you prefer other channels, you can also email the support team at support@funrize.com, which is useful for longer inquiries. Or, you can call them at +1 (208) 826-1426. It‚Äôs great to have so many different options and makes Funrize feel like a really responsive platform.</p><p>We do have one minor criticism in this section, however. Apart from the How it Works part of the menu, which explains the TCs, PEs, and sweepstakes model, there isn‚Äôt a huge amount of basic information about other parts of the site. For instance, we‚Äôd like to see an FAQ section covering stuff like the different banking methods and how the different promotions work.</p><p>But overall, it‚Äôs a positive review from us.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Funrize welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/thesun-funrize-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Register now and collect 75,000 free coins</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ü§î Would we play at Funrize social casino?</h2><p>For sure! <strong><a aria-label="Funrize (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Funrize</a></strong> ticks a lot of boxes and, depending on your requirements from a social casino, could be the perfect option.</p><p>If slots are your thing, Funrize is perfect. The variety of slots on offer is great, including different types of bonus games, jackpots, free spins, and much more. The Fishing games are a fun alternative too. We like the multi-step welcome bonus package (even if it doesn‚Äôt include Promotional Entries off the bat), and the daily Funrize Wheel and Funrize Club Rewards are both a lot of fun. Big shout out to the live chat support too, which is excellent.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest downside is the lack of table games, or really any games outside of slots and Fishing games.
