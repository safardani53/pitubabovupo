It is a comfortable place to accommodate consumers with poor credit scores. The company makes the experience of waiting for a credit check comfortable for customers, and you can easily qualify even if your credit is not quite perfect.&nbsp;</p><p>The annual fee of OpenSky is $35, which is pretty reasonable compared to the organization’s benefits. Since the company does not mind your credit score, you should be satisfied with $35 as a yearly fee. OpenSky’s recommended credit score to get approved ranges from 300 to 689.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the company’s interest rate might be something that can bother you. OpenSky has set its APR, also known as interest rate, to 17.39%, and it is the only thing that concerns most customers. So, if you are not facing any difficulties with your credit score, or if your credit score is higher than 639 or 700, you should adopt other options.&nbsp;</p><p>What other benefits does OpenSky provide? This credit card company is one of those few groups that does not ask for a bank account, so you can proceed without having one in any bank. Also, it benefits customers looking forward to building their credit but cannot, as they lack a bank account.</p><p>You can manage to get a credit card through OpenSky in a relatively easy and painless way. You do not need to provide extensive personal details or bank statements, and you can apply for a credit card through the most straightforward process on the company’s website.

What is best is that no additional deposit amount is needed to access a higher credit line.&nbsp;</li><li><b>No Upgrade to Unsecured Credit Card: </b>Once you have your secured credit card to serve your credit score, you can upgrade it to an unsecured credit card. So, if you decide to change the type of credit card after successfully building a good credit score, you might be unable to do so. In this case, your only option as a credit card holder is closing your account or keeping it open in the same way, i.e., a secure account.</li><li><b>Credit Bureau Reporting: </b>OpenSky reports all of the payment details to all three credit bureaus.

Issued by the Bank of Missouri, the organization’s main objective is to comfort the people struggling with poor or no credit. Although there are many perks to choosing First Access Visa Credit Card, we cannot ignore the high fees and the APR.&nbsp;</p><p>This First Access card does not ask for a credit limit deposit. So, it is not secured but is suitable for most customers who cannot deposit immediate cash.&nbsp;</p><p>There are multiple benefits of choosing the First Access Visa Credit Card. The company does not charge any monthly fees during the first year of getting the card, and since the charges of the Visa card are already slightly higher compared to other cards, the absence of monthly payments for one year gives you some slack.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned before, the Visa card is an unsecured credit card. Also, the credit limit set by First Access is as low as $300, and it is one of the most reasonable credit limits provided by a credit card company in the market. It is worth noting that the company subtracts the annual fee of $75 from the total limit after the first year of ownership.&nbsp;</p><p>The First Access Visa Card has set its APR to be 39.99%, and it imposes the value on all purchases. So, we suggest thoroughly reading all of the terms and conditions before signing up for the Visa card. Additionally, you would be charged a nominal sign-on fee as a customer. Once you get your application approved successfully, you are charged about $95 collectively.&nbsp;</p><h4><b>Highlights</b></h4><ul><li><b>Monthly Service Fees: </b>First Access does not charge any monthly service fee for one year. After that, the customer has to pay $8.25 per month from the 13th month of ownership. So, the overall cash you have to pay is $99 per year.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Fees for an Increase in Credit Limit: </b>The customer becomes eligible to apply for an increase in the credit limit from the 13th month of their ownership. Once again, the application includes some charges, and they will charge you 20% for this assessment. The increase in your credit limit will determine the decision over this 20%.</li><li><b>Supplementary Card Availability: </b>Through First Access, you can get another credit card associated with your card. The charges would be exact, and you would not be charged extra for this service. You would only need to pay an annual fee, like your regular card.&nbsp;</li><li><b>24/7 Customer Service: </b>First Access Visa Credit Card provides you with the best customer service.

These factors do not only include comparing fees of companies. Instead, we carefully analyzed which company offers a more outstanding deal of benefits. The benefits may be special discounts, betterment in credit score, and the time taken by the company to dispatch your card.&nbsp;</p><h3><b>What We Looked For</b></h3><p>To compile our list, we revised all of the criteria to provide the best information for you. Here is our point-by-point explanation of everything we considered while narrowing down our list to the best credit cards for bad credit.</p><ul><li><b>Security: </b>We ensured every organization we suggest provides a security deposit, as this confirms protection when a consumer does not pay. Once you close your account, you can get all of the security you deposited back. Since a secured credit card cuts off the probability of any risks, it is wise to get one.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Customer Service: </b>People often neglect customer service while listing the best credit cards for bad credit. However, we made sure not to skip it. These companies stick to a team with the most appropriate behavior to customers. Besides, the method of credit card delivery is essential, so most of these companies bring the credit card to your doorstep.</li><li><b>Exclusive Discounts: </b>Different companies have different approaches to benefit, attract, and retain their customers. Hence, companies offer various types of discounts. Most people prefer companies that lend a helping hand with extra offers and discounts. We looked into numerous organizations in the market to choose the ones renowned for their deals and offers.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Customer Reviews:&nbsp; </b>Customer reviews say a lot about a company, and we believe in what experienced customers say. We inspected and researched the companies online and highlighted comments and personal reviews of customers. After we skipped companies with negative reviews, we had enlisted only those known for their satisfied customers.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><b>Factors to Consider Before Getting Credit Cards for Bad Credit</b></h2><p>Although the marketplace is full of companies offering the best credit cards for bad credit, choosing the best for you may be challenging. We have maintained a well-researched list of credit cards you should consider. However, it is essential to know what you should look for while choosing the credit card you need.&nbsp;</p><p>We have compiled some briefly-explained factors you should learn. These factors will help you distinguish between choices while you are on your way to ordering a credit card for yourself.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</li></ul><p>Often known as interest rate, the APR is the first thing you should look for while choosing a credit card for bad credit. Since you are already on your journey to win a good credit score, you should comfort yourself in this regard and smooth things up.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a tip to help you compare the APRs of different cards. Check the standard or most common APR in the market and what companies offer. If you feel like the credit card you are looking forward to is charging more than it should, drop that choice immediately.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Repayment Amount</li></ul><p>A customer is asked to repay if they fail to pay off the balance each month. Almost all credit card companies have a well-defined percentage of repayment. Typically, the company charges a consumer 3% of their current balance. However, many credit card companies charge higher. Go for the credit cards that offer a minimum refund. Once again, compare the ratios with different cards in the market and choose what suits you best.</p><ul><li>Loyalty Rewards</li></ul><p>Many credit cards offer loyalty points whenever you make a transaction or payment. These points sum up and can help you in buying stuff. You can make online or even offline purchases through these points, and these act as a small prize for your punctual payments. So, while searching for the best-secured card option, we recommend looking for these minute rewards as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting your money back is always a good thing. Credit cards refund the proportions of your money, judging you on your transactions and payments. For instance, if you make all of your payments on time and are punctual with every transaction for a few months, credit cards would help you in cashback.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Annual Fee</li></ul><p>Different cards have different yearly fees. So, it is essential to look for this aspect before confirming any credit card for bad credit. Multiple companies might charge you higher than ever, but you should skip them. Take two to three credit card companies into consideration, and compare the annual fees. The annual fee adds to the due amount, and APR is applied to the whole amount. So, it is better to check the percentage before it is too late.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>FAQs: Credit Cards for Bad or No Credit&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h2><h3><b>Q1. Can I get a credit card if I have a less-than-perfect credit score?&nbsp;</b></h3><p>Having bad credit does not necessarily mean a dead-end street. There are multiple credit cards specially designed for poor credit scores, and we have compiled a list above that vividly briefs all of them. These credit cards do not check credit score or financial history and accept every type of credit.</p><p>The interest rates or annual fees for bad credit might be slightly higher than the other. Still, the options are not limited. Secured credit cards are often offered to customers with a bad credit score, and consumers have to deposit a minute amount in the account for a secured credit card. However, the money is paid back when the customer closes their account in a good position.&nbsp;</p><h3><b>Q2. What should I look for while getting a credit card for bad credit?&nbsp;</b></h3><p>There are multiple factors you should consider to avoid scams. So, be considerate and close to reality, as you will have to compromise on a few things. With a bad credit score, you might not be able to get outstanding awards, and interest rates might be high. Still, you have to keep your eyes open when making decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Before choosing a credit card, check for the annual fees and the interest rate of the particular card. If you feel that any company has sky-high annual charges, skip it, as there is no deficiency of options. Moreover, look for the discount offers and rewards. Different credit cards offer various tips and points to attract customers. If you are finding a good deal of prize points on a credit card, go for it and take the opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>Deeply research the authenticity of the credit card.
