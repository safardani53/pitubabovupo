We tried to put that on screen. All of it.”</p><p>It was scandals such as the death of silent actress Virginia Rappe following a rape at a party in 1921, and the cold-blooded murder of director William Taylor a year later, that led to the Hays Code being introduced in 1930.</p><p>William Hays, the Chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, brought in the guiding principle that no film “will lower the moral standards of those who see it”.</p><p>Damien said: “Towards the end of the 1920s there was this sort of rash of suicides, deaths, drug overdoses, and I found it coincided with the transition from silent to sound.</p><p>“I started looking at the kind of extreme living, the passion, ambition and recklessness of all stripes that characterised Hollywood at that time, and it got my brain going.”</p><p>Wild child Clara Bow was never going to adapt easily to the puritanical code.</p><p>The New Yorker rose from destitution to become Hollywood’s No1 box office star, making more than 50 movies in 11 years.</p><p>1920s Hollywood really was a cesspool of vice, hubris and excess.

All I had to do was think of home.”</p><p>The characters she played were working-class women who drank, smoked and flirted, which made her popular with the masses. At her peak she received 45,000 fan letters a month.</p><p>The 1927 movie It popularised the term It Girl and in the same year she bathed naked in the film Hula.</p><p>It was shocking at the time, because Victorian attitudes of covering up all flesh still dominated much of society.</p><p>Clara later said: “I don’t want to be remembered as some- body who couldn’t do nothing but take her clothes off.”</p><p><a href=#>Margot</a> has also had to shrug off the association with stripping off that came following her appearance in <a href=#>The Wolf Of Wall Street</a>.</p><p>But she says that displaying wild abandon in Babylon doesn’t bother her because it is in keeping with the character. “I’d feel embarrassed if it was me, but it’s all her,” she says.</p><p>In the script, Margot’s character kisses both men and women.</p><p>Off screen, Clara insisted there were no moral clauses in her studio contracts because she wanted to bed men without getting in trouble.</p><p>Romantically linked to her co-stars the movie idols Gary Cooper and Bela Lugosi, she was also named in numerous divorce proceedings for allegedly stealing women’s husbands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2k1b7ng-brad-pitt-diego-calva-778191189.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tale-outsized-ambition-outrageous-excess-778184978.jpg><p>Gary Cooper became one of Tinseltown’s biggest names, starring in the likes of High Noon, but it was Clara who helped him get his first break.</p><p>She got him a role alongside her in 1927 <a href=#>First World War</a> epic Wings, the first movie to win a Best Picture Oscar.</p><p>Tragically, Clara developed <a href=#>mental health</a> issues similar to her mum that resulted in her attempting suicide.</p><p>She was given shock therapy, before retiring to live on a farm with actor husband Rex Bell and bringing up their two sons Rex Jr and George.</p><p>Clara made her final movie in 1933 and died in 1965 at the age of 60 from heart disease.</p><p>Undoubtedly she was an early example of an incredible talent being used up and discarded by the unforgiving movie business.</p><p>Many believe the stress of making so many films in such a short time contributed to her breakdown.</p><p><a href=#>Brad’s</a> character is said to be based on Douglas Fairbanks, a swashbuckling screen idol who put down Hollywood’s foundations.</p><p>I remember being on set and thinking, ‘I’ll never be in a film as crazy as this ever again’.
