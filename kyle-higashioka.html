He is the eldest son of his parents, Ted and Diane Higashioka.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, he has a younger brother in the family whom he cares for deeply.&nbsp;</p><p>Born and brought up in Huntington Beach, Kyle is a fourth-generation Japanese-American living in California. Higashioka’s great-grandfather and his family had migrated to the USA before the Second World War.</p><p>His grandfather, Shigeru Higashioka, was a war veteran who had fought for the American Army in Europe and earned a Bronze Star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kyle-Higashioka-left-with-his-father-and-younger-brother-e1660382323327.jpg><p>His father, Ted, was a resident of Japan for several years during his childhood as his family later lived and returned to Japan. Shigeru had taken his family back to Japan as he worked there as an oil company executive.</p><p>After spending several years, Ted came back to the USA and settled in Huntington Beach. Once he returned, he felt no need to speak Japanese much as they had very few Japanese neighbors where they lived.</p><p>As a result, his son Kyle too never thought of learning about his heritage.</p><p>Instead, as Kyle came across more Spanish-speaking friends while growing up, he felt the need to learn it and is quite proficient in Spanish other than English. He only started taking Japanese language classes when he met the Japanese pitcher Masahiro Tanaka.</p><p>Now, it has already been more than four years since he started taking up an interest in his Japanese roots, their people, and their culture. Higashioka finally feels content and admits that having a family with mixed family background is a blessing.</p><p>Higashioka’s mother, Diane, is a White American.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Growing up alongside his younger brother in California, Kyle and his sibling attended Edison High School in Huntington Beach. After graduating high school, he enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley, for higher education.</p><p>Although he had initially intended to pursue his baseball career after graduating, he left his college studies unfinished after signing a contract with the New York Yankees.</p><p>However, he later joined the Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa and studied Mechanical Engineering as promised to his mother, Diane.</p><p><a href=#>Timothy Donald Locastro, known as <strong>Tim Locastro</strong>, is an American baseball outfielder for the New York Yankees of the MLB. He has been in the major league games since 2017. Know about him here!</a></p><h2>Kyle Higashioka | Career</h2><h3>Minor Leagues Career</h3><p>Soon after New York Yankees selected him in the seventh round while out of high school, Kyle decided to pursue his professional baseball career. He was with the Tampa Yankees and Trenton Thunder throughout 2012, playing Class A-Advanced State Leagues.</p><p>However, Kyle missed almost two seasons after he suffered a severe injury at the end of the 2012 season. He hurt his thumb and elbow so seriously that he had to undergo Tommy John surgery to recover from his elbow injury fully.</p><p>Fortunately, the 2016 season for Kyle was pretty satisfactory. He initially played for the Trenton Thunder in Class AA Eastern League, and his performance was awe-inspiring.</p><p>Consequently, he got an opportunity to play for the Scranton/ Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, a Triple-A affiliate club of the Yankees. In 2017, the Yankees promoted Higashioka to the major league after their catcher Gary Sanchez suffered an injury.</p><h3>MLB Career</h3><p>Eventually, after ten years of his draft selection, Kyle Higashioka made his MLB debut as a defensive replacement on April 10, 2017. Sadly, he had to return to RailRiders in May after Sanchez recovered from his injuries.</p><p>The rest of the 2017 season was unpredictable and irregular for him. He moved back and forth between MiLB and MLB, with a knee injury complicating things for him in the meantime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kyle-Higashioka-with-the-New-York-Yankees-e1660388509634.jpg><p>Higashioka started his 2018 season with the RailRiders, but the Yankees called him back to the major league after Sanchez suffered another injury. This time, Kyle played 72 matches, averaging .167/.241/.319 at-bats.</p><p>Kyle succeeded in the later seasons even though he did not get many matches to play for the Yankees. In addition, he set some new records, such as becoming the 24th Yankee to have a three-home run game in 2019 and the first Yankee to catch a no-hitter since 1999 in 2021.</p><p>Higashioka has already started playing as a prominent catcher for the Yankees now and is doing pretty well in the ongoing season.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Matt Strahm</strong> is an American-born professional baseball player, starring as a pitcher for the MLB team, the Boston Red Sox.

Sadly for them, Kyle is a married man and is very happy that he is married to his longtime girlfriend, Alyse.</p><p>You can tell how happy he is to have her by going through his Insta profile, whose bio reads, “I am a married baseball player.” Besides, the player’s social media handle is full of appreciation posts for his beautiful wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kyle-Higashioka-and-his-wife-Alyse-e1660397938804.jpg><p>Talking more about Alyse, she is a little older than Kyle as she was born on April 3, 1990, just seventeen days before he was born.
