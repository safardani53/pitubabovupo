In June 2017, he posted a photo of himself wearing a cheeky T-shirt that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated Gadot's role as Wonder Woman</a>. The shirt read "Your Wife / My Wife" and had a drawing of the iconic superhero above the "My Wife" words.

"I'm so lucky to be married to a strong independent woman," he wrote. "I learn from her on a daily basis, she empowers me and helps me become a better version of myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Varsano continued: "Our relationship is based on equality and mutual respect.

"It was my husband who told me: 'Gal, think about what kind of a role model you want to be. If you want to show Alma that she can follow her dreams, that's what you should do, and we will figure out the logistics,' " Gadot recalled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gadot recognized <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her husband</a> again in August 2023, when she told&nbsp;Flaunt&nbsp;magazine that Varsano encouraged her to pursue acting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He was the one to give me the courage to do it, to travel with me,” she said. “He’s the dreamer — he’s the kite that will reach out to the sky whereas I’m the root, the tree that the kite is connected to.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gadot added: “I would never be where I am without him."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hes-a-girl-dad></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He's a girl dad</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gal Gadot Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple are the proud parents of three daughters.

Varsano and the couple's daughter Maya both <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>make a cameo</a> in the carousel scene near the end of the film.

"As producers, we want to help bring stories that have inspired us to life," the couple said in a statement, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Deadline</a>.

"He told me on our second date he was serious and wasn't going to wait more than two years to ask me to marry him," she told the outlet. "Fast-forward two years, he proposed. We were married in 2008."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked if she also knew he was the one, Gadot answered, "I think I did, but I was too young to get it. He did! He's 10 years older than me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Varsano's intuition was right as the couple are still going strong today, over a decade later. In 2021, on their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>13th wedding anniversary</a>, Gadot posted a wedding photo on Instagram and penned a sweet message to her husband in the caption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Look at those two kids on the happiest day of their lives..." she wrote.
