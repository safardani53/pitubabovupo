and although they weren't perfect, they decided it would do.</p><p>"There were bad reviews but there were also good reviews saying, 'Not as bad as people say'," Magdalena explained.</p><p>"All together, we paid around £860 including the transfer and extra luggage.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON HOLIDAY NIGHTMARES">READ MORE ON HOLIDAY NIGHTMARES</h2><p>"It did say that the hotel was basic, but that wasn't a problem for us provided that it's clean, because we wanted to go out and explore anyway."</p><p>The couple booked the budget holiday through loveholidays and likened their experience with being on TV's<a href=#> I'm A Celebrity.</a></p><p>There were warning signs from the moment the couple touched down in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Palma</a>&nbsp;on May 15, but exhausted from the day’s travelling, they did not take heed.</p><p>Magdalena told PA Real Life: “We went up to the transfer desk and the driver asked where we were staying.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>“He said ‘Oh Sun Club Eldorado’ and then started laughing.</p><p>“That was the first thing I should have picked up on.”</p><p>Next, they were bizarrely handed two brightly coloured plastic cups at check-in and told they were to present these at the bar whenever they wanted to order a drink.</p><p>She said: “The first night I went to the bar and asked for a sangria and the guy says, ‘Where is your cup? You must have been given cups at arrival?’</p><p>“I was like, you have got to be joking me.</p><p>The hotel's insane drinks rule meant that the couple had to use the same cups for coffee the next morning.</p><p>"It was the weirdest thing - we were supposed to use it for our alcohol, our tea, juice, coke, sprite, whatever, everything was poured in the same cup," she said.</p><p>“They weren’t even washed properly, I had to wash them myself using my own shower gel.”</p><p>But Magdalena was faced with an even bigger shock when she opened her bathroom door.</p><p>“The bathroom was absolutely disgusting – just filthy,” she said.</p><p>She called reception to complain, but when nobody had turned up by noon the next day, Magdalena decided to take matters into her own hands.</p><p>“I went out and bought some bleach, sanitary wipes and anti-bacterial gel,” she said.</p><p>“I cleaned the shower and black stains in the bathroom but left the floor, because it’s not really my job.</p><p>“When someone finally came, he pulled a handful of black hair out of the shower and threw it in my bathroom bin.”</p><p>The furious holidaymaker said she then tried contacting loveholidays after three days at the resort to see if they could be moved, but "nothing happened".</p><p>The pair began looking at flights home but they were too expensive, so they went hunting for another hotel in Palma, the island’s capital.</p><p>“When we arrived in Palma, I thought I had been let out of the I’m A Celebrity camp,” said Magdalena.</p><p>“We sat in a coffee shop holding an actual coffee cup in our hands.</p><p>“This was the point where I couldn’t take it anymore and I said to my husband, Andrew, I think the celebrities in the jungle have better conditions than us.”</p><p>Finally the couple found an affordable alternative, hotel Tal El Arenal, and packed their bags.</p><p>“We managed to get out on Saturday morning,” she said.</p><p>“The hotel cost £425 for five nights.</p><p>“I went to reception and asked for a refund for the five unused nights but the only thing they gave us back was 11 euros tourist tax money.”</p><p>Magdalena said the rest of their holiday was “really good” with “great food” and “normal cups”.</p><p>“I will not book a holiday with loveholidays for the rest of my life," she added.</p><p>It's understood the pair has received refunds for the days they did not use the hotel or its facilities.</p><p>A loveholidays spokesperson said: “We’re sorry Ms Brylinska-Beaton’s experience did not live up to her expectations on this occasion. While we always encourage customers to raise any issues with our dedicated in-resort team at the time so we can address them, we’ve reviewed her case and issued a refund for the days she did not use the hotel.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>This comes after one dad's <a href=#>dream five-star TUI holiday turned into hell </a>when he was struck with a horrific "mystery illness".</p><p>And one <a href=#>woman's summer holiday was ruined</a> after she came into contact with a plant worse than Japanese knotweed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NINTCHDBPICT000826073184.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NINTCHDBPICT000826073013.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ394g5FtaHJnmKS7psXMqKanZaKqtq%2Bxw2akmqKfp7CiedGeqqiqpKh6uLHIq5tmnKKeu6y%2FjKuspZ1dmba0s9Ssq6Kml2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tekashi-6ix9ine-could-be-detained-in-dominican-republic-for-years.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tekashi 6ix9ine Could Be Detained in Dominican Republic for Years</a>
