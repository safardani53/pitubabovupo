The Olympic runner was <a href=#>born missing the outside of his feet as well as both fibulae</a> but that didn't stop him from achieving greatness in the sport he loved. Allegedly that also came with danger. On the morning of Feb. 14, 2013, Pistorius claimed, he heard noises from inside his bathroom. Grabbing his gun, he went to investigate.</p><p>Although his girlfriend, model <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reeva Steenkamp</a>, was also in the house, Pistorius insisted it was an intruder locked in his bathroom. "I fired shots at the toilet door and shouted to Reeva to phone the police," he said, claiming he soon learned it was Steenkamp in the bathroom. Pistorius killed his girlfriend and would later receive a prison sentence of 13 and a half years. In January 2024 he was paroled, a decision which has deeply upset Steenkamp's family. Where are Reeva Steenkamp's parents? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Reeva Steenkamp's parents, Barry Steenkamp and June Steenkamp, sit in the Pretoria High Court on Sept. 11, 2014</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Only one of Reeva Steenkamp's parents lived to see Oscar Pistorius paroled.</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associate Press</a> reported that Barry Steenkamp, Reeva Steenkamp's father, passed away at age 60 on Sept. 15, 2023. A foundation was set up in Reeva's name after her death and in a statement they said, "It is with heavy hearts that we announce the sudden and peaceful passing of Barry Steenkamp. Barry was a blessing to many, and he will be remembered with love and great fondness."</p><p>Initially both Barry and his wife, June Steenkamp, said they forgave Pistorius but they soon changed their minds. "After all these years we are still waiting for him to admit he did it in anger. That is all we wanted," said Barry to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a> in February 2023. "But I was wasting my time. He is a murderer. He should remain in jail."</p><p>Upon learning of Pistorius's parole, June released a statement on behalf of herself and her late husband via a family lawyer. "I do not believe Oscar’s version that he thought the person in the toilet was a burglar," she said per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>. "In fact, I do not know anybody who does. My dearest child screamed for her life. ... I believe he knew it was Reeva."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Oscar Pistorius leaves the Pretoria High Court on June 15, 2016, after the third day of his resentencing hearing for the 2013 murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp</p></figure><p>In a separate statement obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, June was far more heartbroken by the turn of events. "Has there been justice for Reeva? Has Oscar served enough time," asked June. "There can never be justice if your loved one is never coming back, and no amount of time served will bring Reeva back."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oscar Pistorius may be out of prison but he will still be heavily monitored.</h2><p>Outside of the prison where Pistorius served his time, Department of Corrections spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo detailed the conditions of his release. He will not be permitted to leave Pretoria and will have to attend an anger management program plus another program that focuses on violence against women. There will also be mandatory community service.</p><p>"Parole does not mean the end of the sentence. It is still part of the sentence," explained Nxumalo per the Associated Press. "It only means the inmate will complete the sentence outside a correctional facility." He will be assigned what is essentially a parole officer who is tasked with keeping track of Pistorius and will have to be notified if Pistorius wants to make any significant changes in his life such as moving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7KmwsBmqq2dlaO4ornPZqeaqpWjwbQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dwayne-johnson-the-rock-pics.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dwayne Johnson The Rock Johnson Photos Of The Star Hollywood Life</a>
