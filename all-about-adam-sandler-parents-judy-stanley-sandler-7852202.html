His mother worked as a nursery school teacher and his father was an electrical contractor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>60 Minutes</a>, Judy was described as his biggest fan, and their close relationship shows in the loving maternal characters in Adam’s films. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Murder Mystery 2</a> star’s father, Stanley, was the inspiration for the character of Stanley Sugerman, a basketball recruiter Adam portrayed in 2022’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Hustle</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My mother said how great I was all the time,” Adam said. “I started to believe her. But my father would be like, ‘You’re great, but you ain’t that great.' ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stanley died of lung cancer in 2003. Nearly two decades later, Adam paid tribute to his late father in a sweet <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>series of Father’s Day tweets</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We talk to our kids all the time about just how damn cool and smart he was and what he would have said in certain situations if he was here,” the actor-comedian wrote in part in 2022. “Miss that man everyday and thank him for his warmth, his love for my mom, and always putting his family first.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who are Adam Sandler's parents?

When Adam was six, the couple moved him and his older siblings to Manchester, New Hampshire.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was Scott who encouraged Adam to try his hand at comedy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If he hadn’t said to do it, I wouldn’t have thought it was a normal thing to do. I would have said, ‘Mom and Dad are going to get mad at me,’ ” Adam told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Interview</a> in 1994. “But because he told me to do it, and I knew that my parents respected his brain, I was like, ‘He said to do it, so it must be O.K.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Billy Madison star recalls his childhood as happy, telling the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Washington Post</a> that his parents were supportive, with Judy praising his singing. When Adam was 12, Stanley bought his son an electric guitar, which the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Saturday Night Live</a> alum still takes out on stage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I didn’t have a lot of the pain that some comedians talk about, like problems with drugs and stuff like that. Everybody always had my back growing up," Adam told<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> AARP</a>. “When we had company, my mother would take peanuts out and put toothpicks in little meatballs and say, ‘Adam, play them a song.' They all loved me. They all laughed, even if some of the guests were probably thinking, We have to watch this f------ kid play guitar right now?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Adam was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>honored with the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize for American Humor</a> in 2023, Judy got up on stage and talked about Adam's idyllic upbringing in New England, paying tribute to her son's "kind and thoughtful” sense of humor. She also joked about his lax clothing choices — "I say he's a slob” — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>before sharing</a>, “We are so proud of him."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-his-parents-werent-in-the-industry-but-supported-adams-hollywood-ambitions></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>His parents weren’t in the industry but supported Adam’s Hollywood ambitions</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Adam Sandler's parents, Judith and Stanley Sandler.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Adam Sandler Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Stanley and Judy gave Adam the freedom to pursue comedy. In fact, it was their initial love of the genre that made a lasting impression on a young Adam. While visiting the Hillcrest Country Club with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Times</a>, he pointed to a photo of the Marx Brothers and said they were his favorite, explaining, “My father would wake me up, and I’d get to watch, you know, Duck Soup or A Night at the Opera.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Growing up, he liked any comedian his parents liked, which included Buddy Hackett and Johnny Carson, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CBS News</a> he wanted to be like the latter because “he's making my dad happy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Adam was in college, he would share his big dreams, and Stanley was happy to let his son pursue a career in Hollywood. If it didn’t work out by 23 or 24, Adam had “this fall back, work for dad thing,” which was joining his father as an electrical contractor. But he told CBS News that he was "so driven” to make his dream happen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I would just say to him, ‘No, no, no, I’m going to be fine. I’m going to make it. I'm going to do good. He'd be like, alright. He'd look at me like I was nuts,” Adam recalled. "My mother, on the other hand, was like, ‘Oh, he's going to be wonderful!’ Because she thought every move I made was great."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Uncut Gems star added that his mom was easy to make laugh, though she often didn’t understand the joke, just that her son was trying to be funny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And then my father, man, when he laughed, boy, you were excited. You were excited that the big man was good and thought it was funny, because he was a smart guy,” Adam said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stanley-died-in-2003></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stanley died in 2003</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Adam Sandler with his father, Stanley Sandler.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Adam Sandler Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stanley died of lung cancer in 2003. He was 68.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During a 2019 segment on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>60 Minutes</a> where Adam gave a tour of his childhood home, Stanley was described as a big man with a big personality whom the Funny People star called his hero. Adam said as much on Twitter, now known as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>X</a>, calling Stanley "the greatest man I ever knew.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Great husband.

Thanks for having me and miss you everyday!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adam paid a similar tribute for Father’s Day 2022, saying he, his siblings and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>his wife, Jackie Sandler</a>, all knew they “had a great one,” and when they “heard his footsteps coming down the hall… all the fun in the world was home.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Loved every meal, car ride, tv watch, late nite talk, phone call, beach day, boat trip, driving range, baseball catch, and giant family hang we had.
