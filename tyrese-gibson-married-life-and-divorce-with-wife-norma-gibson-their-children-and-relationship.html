Let's know the details of Tyrese's&nbsp; relationships, children and married life.</p><h2>Married life of Tyrese Gibson&nbsp;</h2><p>Well, let's start from the beginning, Tyrese, who has been married twice, got to <a href=#>meet his ex-wife Norma Gibson back in 2002 when she was going to school</a>. Soon after the encounter, they both fell in love. Their growing love led them to move to Los Angels together and, after dating for 5 years, Tyrese Gibson and wife Norma Gibson married on in LA.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><img alt="Tyrese Gibson and his ex-wife Norma Gibson" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3540810.1507130909!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/tyrese5f-1-web.jpg ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Many might not know, but the same year of their marriage, <a href=#>Tyrese and Norma welcomed their daughter Shayla Somer Gibson, on July 11, 2007</a>. But, the happiness of the couple did not outlast&nbsp;the dark shadow of&nbsp;mishap that was about to engulf the family.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img alt="Tyrese Gibson with his daughter Shayla Somer Gibson" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/entertainmentrundown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tyrese-Gibson-Daughter.jpg ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Rumors started after it was revealed that&nbsp;Tyrese had not been talking to his wife for a long time.

And later, after proposing Samantha on her Instagram, they tied the knot.</p><p>Well, the new couple is yet to be parents. And regarding&nbsp;his marriage, Tyrese expressed his happiness and love to his second wife and daughter as:&nbsp;</p><p>We're humbled by the outpouring of love! We appreciate all of the prayers and well wishes. Sometimes when you pray you get exactly what your heart desires. &nbsp;I didn't just marry her I married my daughters new example.</p><p>Tyrese loves his daughter as much as he loves his life.</p><h2>Tyrese Gibson becomes proud after winning custody of his daughter</h2><p>After his divorce, Tyrese went through a messy legal&nbsp;battle with his ex-wife Norma for the custody of their only daughter Shayla Somer Gibson. He was accused by his ex-wife of assaulting and torturing his daughter physically and mentally. But he denied the accusation, claiming that nothing was more important to him than his daughter.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>He even posted his video shedding the tears requesting not to take her child away from her, which became viral. Here is the video.</p><p></p><p>Tyrese has stated that he was not able to see his daughter for more than 2 months after the court ordered him&nbsp;to stay away from Shayla and Norma.&nbsp;The case finally closed recently after a 7-year-long legal battle.&nbsp;</p><p>Tyrese posted a caption on his Instagram&nbsp;saying that he was coming for his daughter. Have a look.</p><p><a href=#>#Papz got us #DaddyDaughterSeason #UAE and #AFRICA Iâm on my way! #ShaylaRocks.com Friday was not a win for me, it is a win for our daughter, Shayla. Who unfortunately has been exposed to tension, private and public embarrassment and growing up and feeling torn between 2 parents who are no longer married...... It is a win because she gets to spend equal time with both of her parents in joint legal custody while she continues to grow in a happy and healthy environment â this has always been and will continue to be my priority. I hope all of the fathers feel encouraged by this cause if was the real âFathersâ out there who reached out and kept me encouraged along the way and for that I canât thank you enough... - For 10 years I have been the best father I could be, all while quietly being on the receiving end of constant toxic false accusations by the mother of my child. And of course all the while being thrusted into unexpected social media storms all while trying to fight for my career and stay afloat financially. Today I am proud that the courts have put an end to Normaâs toxic nonsense, declaring that NONE of her accusations for the last 10 years against me are credible. I did not break any laws; I did not harass anyone; and most important I never engaged in violent or abusive behavior. The physical and emotional violence that Norma publicly accused of were all false and ruled to have no merit, no evidence, and was unsubstantiated in a court of law. I am forever indebted to my attorney Terry Ross who brought my truth to light in supporting me, my wife Samantha and my daughter Shayla and my team who wanted nothing more than for this 10 year nightmare of false claims and accusations to end....... God delivered on his promise that if I stand on my truth and donât bend he will show up for me - Today is the first day of the rest of my life with MY FAMILY, my FRIENDS, my fans and supporters and my business associates and of course my immediate TEAM - God bless you..... broken but I will heal from this #ShaylaRocks.com go there now please!!!!!
