It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something."</p><p>The pair started dating in 2012 after Heard, who identifies as bisexual, split from then-girlfriend Hawaiian artist and photographer Tasya van Ree.</p><p>Two years later, <a href=# rel=noopener>PEOPLE Magazine</a> exclusively reported Heard and Depp were engaged, and a source told the outlet, “... They couldn’t be happier to be engaged and excited to share the rest of their lives together.”</p><p>They got married in a private ceremony at their Los Angeles home in 2015, but one year later, Heard filed for divorce, accusing Depp of physical abuse.</p><p>Depp has since been cleared of the accusations made against him.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON AMBER HEARD</h2></p><h2>What were Amber Heard's accusations against Johnny Depp?</h2><p>Heard accused Depp of physical abuse and wrote an op-ed in <a href=# rel=noopener>The Washington Post</a> in October 2018, "I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out."</p><p>She claimed that Depp had hit her and in the op-ed piece, she said the result of speaking out had allegedly resulted in "death threats."</p><p>The accusations against Depp resulted in the removal of him from the role of Gellert Grindelwald in the Hollywood blockbuster film, <a href=#>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</a>.</p><p>The pair went to court after Depp sued Heard for $50million in a defamation lawsuit, claiming for her op-ed piece, which did not mention him by name, had caused financial loss and his removal from films.</p><p>Heard countersued for $100million, claiming that Depp's attorney defamed her by calling her allegations of abuse a hoax and claimed to have only been violent toward Depp in self-defense.</p><p>Depp repeatedly denied Heard's allegations and during the trial, he said he had lost "nothing less than everything” from Heard's op-ed article.</p><p>“What did it do to me? What effect did it have on me? I’ll put it to you this way: No matter the outcome of this trial, the second the allegations were made against me … once that happened, I lost then,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RTRMADP_PEOPLE-DEPP_747198564_RC23JU9EOWOI_2022-06-01T201305Zjpg-JS737433398.jpg><h2>What was Amber Heard's reaction to the verdict?</h2><p>The <a href=#>trial between Heard and Depp came to a close</a> on May 26, 2022, and the jury read out their final verdict after 13 hours of deliberation over three days.</p><p>The jury found Heard to be guilty of defamation of Depp on three statements and awarded him $15million, meanwhile Heard won on only one of her three counterclaims, awarding her $2million.</p><p>"From the very beginning, the goal of bringing this case was to reveal the truth, regardless of the outcome," Depp said in a statement on June 1, adding, "Speaking the truth was something that I owed to my children and to all those who have remained steadfast in their support of me. I feel at peace knowing I have finally accomplished that.</p><p>"The jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled."</p><p>Heard spoke out via her press secretary after the verdict, saying she was disappointed and "heartbroken" over the jury's decision to award Depp all three of his claims against her.</p><p>“The disappointment I feel today is beyond words," she said.</p><p>"I’m even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback. It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously.</p><p>"I’m sad I lost this case. But I am sadder still that I seem to have lost a right I thought I had as an American — to speak freely and openly.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>CBS News</a> legal contributor Jessica Levinson said it was clear the jury took the case seriously and looked in-depth at each claim of defamation.</p><p>Speaking on the jury's verdict, Levinson said, "It wasn't just a case of, 'We like Johnny Depp, we don't like Amber Heard.' I think at the end of the day, the punchline is that the jury found they both lied."</p><p>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?<br>Email us at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusive@the-sun.com</a> or call <a href=# rel=nofollow>212 416 4552</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpYGl%2BeYKUaK6hp12WuqOx0WafnpmimXqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-dominique-tipper-dating.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Dominique Tipper Dating Now</a>
