with the best microfibre beach towels you’ll be set for both sunbathing on the beach and drying off after a dip in the pool.</p><p>They weigh so much less than traditional towels, fold up really small (so you can easily fit a few of them into your suitcase, alongside your <a href=# rel=noopener>shades</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>sun cream</a>), are just as absorbent and they’re quick drying – depending on the brand they dry three to eight times faster than a cotton towel.</p><p>They're also great for the gym and perfect if you get caught in the rain while walking your dog.</p><p>You'll find microfibre beach towels in the same array of colours and prints as traditional beach towels, whether you're looking for simple, solid colour or summer-ready stripes.</p><p>Lots of different shapes and sizes are also available, from extra-large versions to cosy ponchos that wrap you up warmly after a chilly sea swim.</p><p>There are also extra-thick varieties for when the cold weather hits, and some microfibre beach towels even repel sand – a big bonus for anyone who wants to leave the beach at the beach.</p><p>Check out our selection of the best microfibre beach towels to buy this summer.</p><h2><strong>Best microfibre beach towels at a glance:</strong></h2><h2><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Dock & Bay Lightweight Beach Towel</span></h2><img

after they appeared on the hit TV show.</p><p>The towel is said to repel sand – simply give it a shake and all sand will swiftly fall off, making it the ultimate beach BFF.</p><p>Dock & Bay's stylish towels also come in a range of prints and they're definitely some of the most fashion-forward we've seen, including animal prints, tropical leaves, flowers and our personal favourite - the classic bright stripe.</p><p>The towels are available in two sizes: Large, which measures 160x90cm and Extra Large, which is 200x90cm, both of which are more than enough to envelop you nicely after a swim.</p><p>The company's microfibre beach towels dry three times faster than a normal towel, roll up to be ultra-compact (they each include a travel carry case) and the design even includes a hook, so they can hang when not in use.</p><p>Oh, and did we mention that every towel is made from 100% recycled materials?
